# Find-and-correct-mistakes
Find mistake in text, using dictionary suggest a correct words and remember prefixes and suffixes.
Program gets a text with mistakes (one letter mistakes) in words and tries to find correct version of these word and asks
user to correct these mistakes. Program also looks at a type of wrong word (e.g. dictjonaries -> dictionaries, 
dictjonary -> dictionary), so it remembers suffixes and prefixes and operates only on main part of word. In dictionary.txt
are 'main parts' of words, in text.txt is a text with mistakes, in new_text.txt will be corrected text (if user accepts
auto-correct) and in project_find_mistake.ipynb is a jupyter notebook file (Python 3) with whole code :) .
